I provided the following 4 consecutive prompts to generate this HTML file.

## Prompt 1
Create an html form with inputs for names of attendees, the event name, and the date. The form should have a button that when clicked allows adding an attendee to the list of attendees. The form should also have a button that when clicked generates a .txt file with a list of the attendees, the name of the event, and the date.

## Prompt 2
Update the code to include a button to remove attendees from the list of attendees.

## Prompt 3
Great! Now can you name the .txt file that is generated with the following convention: {Date}_{EventName}.txt

## Prompt 4
Make the form pretty with CSS.
